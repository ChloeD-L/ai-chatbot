# Care Workflow Assistant

This is a Next.js project powered by the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai) and OpenAI (GPT-4o), providing a generative UI experience that supports:

- **General AI Chat** powered by OpenAI
- **Caregiver task assistant** that converts natural language into structured care workflows
- **Generative UI** integration via tool calling (function calling)

## Features

- **Built with Vercel AI SDK's Generative UI** — uses `useChat` and tool calling to dynamically generate structured UI from model responses
- **OpenAI GPT-4o integration** for both general-purpose chat and task-specific logic
- **Caregiver assistant** that transforms natural language into actionable workflows
- 🔧 **Tool-based architecture** with structured task generation via Zod schema validation
- Clean, responsive design using **Tailwind CSS** and **shadcn/ui**
- Built with **Next.js App Router** for modern routing and layout structure

## 💡 Use Case

Caregivers can describe their tasks in plain language (e.g., _"Morning routine for John: medication, breakfast, and mobility exercises"_) and receive a structured task workflow including:

- Task title and description
- Status and priority
- Required equipment
- Safety and compliance notes

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
